# I want to improve my knowledge on Microservices. 

This showcase is only for educational purposes. I introduced some worthless layers just to practice on foreign technologies.

Forgive me for potential suboptimal uses of these technologies. The code will be mantained and optimized step by step.

While working on this repository, I could pivot on some technologies, just for fun. This is **exactly** the purpose of a microservices system.
